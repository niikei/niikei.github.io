            <h3>Created a Website!</h3>
            <p>I wanted a way to share what I'm doing, so I created a website. I chose GitHub Pages because it was free
                and
                seemed easy to use.<br>
                For "Currently Reading" page, I use Google Spreadsheet as a database and fetch data using GAS. You can
                sort
                the table by clicking on the column names. The table layout changes slightly between the desktop and
                mobile
                versions, which is a small detail I'm proud of. Try rotating your phone to see the difference.<br>
                The design is pretty basic, so I might improve it in the future.

            <p>My paper submitted to an international conference has been conditionally accepted. If all goes well, I
                will
                be presenting it in Spain! This is a great opportunity and I'm very excited about it.</p>

            <h3>Created a VS Code Extension for Japanese Text Proofreading</h3>
            <p>
                I created a VS Code extension called <a
                    href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=niikei.japanese-proofreading-info&ssr=false#overview">(非公式)
                    テキスト校正くん with info</a>. I often used the extension called <a
                    href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ICS.japanese-proofreading">テキスト校正くん</a>,
                but I
                found it a bit inconvenient when it showed errors in problematic areas. So, I forked it and made
                modifications to display information instead of errors.
